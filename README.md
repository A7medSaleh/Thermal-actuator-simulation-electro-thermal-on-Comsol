A MEMS thermal actuator is a micromechanical device that typically generates motion by thermal expansion amplification. A small amount of thermal expansion of one part of the device translates to a large amount of deflection of the overall device. This rise in temperature can be induced by many ways . In this model I use the difference in electric resistance of the two acuator branch to induce the difference in temperature by making one brance very thin (higher resistance) than the other so it get hotter and expand more.

I make an accurate modeling for the device on Comsol using compination of the electrical, thermal and mechanical effect and physics to study its behavior.
